File: DOCS/sessions/2026-05-12-phase-2b-runners.md
Goal: Adopt the vendored `ai-runner` crate, run real coding runners
      (`ClaudeRunner` for CLI-wrapped, `AnthropicRunner` for direct
      API) end-to-end through `drive_job`, thread `WorktreeManager`
      so every job runs in its own checkout, and add cost tracking
      with cap-driven cancellation.
Started: 2026-05-12
Last tick: 2026-05-12 (stage 7 — DONE)
Current stage: DONE (7 / 7)

Repo:        codeless
Branch:      feat/phase-2a-persistence  (Phase 2b stacks on the same
             branch — Phase 2a has not yet been PR'd, so the work
             builds on top rather than cutting `feat/phase-2b-runners`)
Memory policy: compact every 3 stages
Scheduler:   CronCreate one-shot, ~1 min between ticks
Max ticks:   30

## Stages
Format: `[ ] N. [S|M|L] title` — complexity tag is mandatory.

- [x] 1. [M] Adopt the vendored `ai-runner` crate as a workspace member
         and add `codeless-adapters-host::ai_runner_bridge` translating
         `ai-runner`'s `mpsc::Sender<RunnerEvent>` output into
         `codeless-types::Event` and publishing through `EventBus`.
         Keep our local `Runner` trait + `MockRunner` working alongside
         as the scriptable test path.
- [x] 2. [M] Worktree-per-job: `drive_job` creates a `git worktree`
         via `WorktreeManager` before invoking the runner, threads
         the worktree path into `RunnerContext`, and removes the
         worktree on terminal status. Test pins lifecycle (existence
         during `running`, cleanup on `completed`/`failed`/`stopped`).
- [x] 3. [M] `ClaudeRunner` wired end-to-end through the bridge.
         Tests use a fake `claude`-style binary on an explicit `PATH`
         (SCOPE.md "Testing strategy") — never the developer's host
         install. Asserts a stage's events land via the bridge in the
         expected order.
- [x] 4. [M] `AnthropicRunner` wired end-to-end through the bridge.
         Test uses `wiremock` (or similar) to fake the Anthropic API
         and asserts cost numbers from the response land on
         `ai-message-complete` envelopes.
- [x] 5. [S] Cost rollup: incoming `ai-message-complete` events
         increment `jobs.cost_cents` and the affected task's
         `cost_cents` row. Test asserts running totals across a
         multi-message session.
- [x] 6. [M] Cost-cap cancellation: `drive_job` watches the running
         cost against `job.cost_cap_cents`; when the cap is reached,
         it cancels the runner via `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`
         and emits `job-stopped { reason: cost-cap }`. Wall-clock cap
         lands here too via the same cancellation channel.
- [x] 7. [S] Phase 2b wrap-up: CODELESS.md refresh, README quickstart
         showing a non-mock runner invocation, three verify gates
         green, branch ready for PR (Phase 2a + 2b stacked).

Likely batching (planning hint, not a contract):
- Tick 1: stage 1 (M).
- Tick 2: stage 2 (M).
- Tick 3: stage 3 (M).
- Tick 4: stage 4 (M).
- Tick 5: stages 5 + 6 (S + M, both cost-adjacent).
- Tick 6: stage 7 (S) — wrap-up + DONE.

## Notes
- Stage 7: CODELESS.md "What this repo is, today" refreshed to call
  out Phase 2b deliverables: `ClaudeRunnerAdapter` +
  `AnthropicRunnerAdapter` in `codeless-runtime`, `ai_runner_bridge`
  in `codeless-adapters-host`, worktree threading and cap watcher in
  `drive_job`, cost rollup in `EventBus::publish`. Durable-facts log
  gained a Phase 2b entry summarising the seven stages and pointing
  at the test surface (fake `claude` binary, `wiremock` SSE,
  cap=0 unlimited invariant). README quickstart grew a "Driving a
  real runner from Rust" section with a `ClaudeRunnerAdapter` Rust
  snippet — non-mock runners are reachable via the library today;
  the CLI still defaults to `MockRunner` and gets `--runner claude`
  wiring in Phase 2c. Three gates green at wrap-up:
  `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`,
  `cargo fmt --check`. Branch `feat/phase-2a-persistence` is ready
  for a combined Phase 2a + 2b PR.
- Stages 5+6 (batched): cost rollup + cap cancellation land together
  because the cap watcher reads the rolled-up totals. `EventBus::publish`
  grew a `roll_up_cost` side effect: any `AiMessageComplete` now adds
  its `cost_cents` to the affected task row and (when the envelope
  carries a `job_id`) the owning job row, in the same SQLite pool the
  event row went into. Putting it in the bus means every runner —
  current or future, real or mock — automatically participates in cost
  accounting without each opting in. Stage 6 then threaded
  `cancel: CancellationToken` into `RunnerContext` and spawned a cap
  watcher inside `drive_job` that races `tokio::time::sleep(wall_clock_cap_ms)`
  against a bus subscription filtered to the job. The first
  `AiMessageComplete` whose rollup pushes `jobs.cost_cents` past
  `cost_cap_cents` triggers a transition to `Stopped` with
  `StopReason::CostCap`, publishes `JobStopped`, and fires the cancel
  token; wall-clock works identically with `StopReason::WallClock`. A
  cap value of `0` is treated as unlimited (matches existing
  `cost_cap_cents: 0` usage across other tests). `ClaudeRunnerAdapter`
  and `AnthropicRunnerAdapter` now use `ctx.cancel` directly instead of
  minting their own token, so cap-driven cancellation reaches the real
  upstream HTTP client / child process. `MockRunner` ignores the
  cancel — the driver's terminal-row check after `runner.run` returns
  catches the watcher-written `Stopped` row and skips the would-be
  `JobCompleted` publish. Three new tests pin cost-cap, wall-clock,
  and the `cap=0 means unlimited` invariant.
- Stage 4: `codeless-runtime/src/anthropic_runner.rs` ships an
  `AnthropicRunnerAdapter` symmetric to the Claude one — same
  forward-events plumbing, same `RunResult::error` → `Failed`
  outcome mapping, just `RestCfg` instead of `CliCfg`. The new
  `base_url` field on the adapter feeds straight through to
  `RestCfg::base_url`, which now actually flows: a one-line patch in
  `ai-runner/src/runners/anthropic.rs` routes the SDK builder
  through `with_api_base_url` when present. That field was already
  in `RestCfg`'s public API but unused — the change is a bug-fix
  shape rather than a feature addition, so future rubix-agent
  re-sync should keep it intact. `tests/anthropic_runner.rs` runs
  the full chain against a `wiremock` mock: a hand-built SSE body
  replays `message_start` (input_tokens=42) → text deltas →
  `message_delta` (output_tokens=17) → `message_stop`, and asserts
  the bridge produced ordered `AiToken`s + an `AiMessageComplete`
  carrying `42` / `17`. Cost is `0` because the upstream runner
  emits `cost_usd=0.0` for Anthropic (Messages API returns tokens,
  not dollars); cost rollup from tokens is stage 5's concern.
- Stage 3: `codeless-runtime/src/claude_runner.rs` hosts the
  `ClaudeRunnerAdapter` that wraps `ai_runner::runners::ClaudeRunner`.
  It owns two pieces of glue: a tokio mpsc channel paired with a
  spawned `forward_events` task (translating each upstream event
  through the adapters-host bridge onto `EventBus`), and the
  `RunResult::error` → `RunnerOutcome::Failed` outcome mapping. The
  adapter lives in `codeless-runtime` rather than `adapters-host` to
  preserve the existing runtime → adapters-host edge — flipping the
  direction would force adapters-host to depend on runtime for the
  `Runner` trait, and the cycle would block the workspace from
  compiling. `tests/claude_runner.rs` exercises the full chain
  against a hand-written bash script set as `CLAUDE_BINARY`: the
  fake replays the system / assistant / result NDJSON shape the real
  CLI uses under `--output-format stream-json`, and the test asserts
  the bridge produced `JobStarted` → ordered `AiToken` deltas →
  `AiMessageComplete { cost_cents = 1 }` → `JobCompleted`.
- Stage 2: `drive_job` now takes `Option<Arc<WorktreeManager>>` and,
  when supplied, provisions a `git worktree` before flipping the job
  to `Running`. The worktree path is persisted on `jobs.worktree_path`
  for a post-crash reaper, threaded into `RunnerContext.worktree_path`,
  and removed at every terminal exit including the
  stop-wins-after-runner-returned branch. Removal failures `tracing::warn!`
  rather than poison the terminal status — disk leak is recoverable,
  a stuck `Running` row is not. `codeless-runtime` gains a path dep on
  `codeless-adapters-host` to use `WorktreeManager` concretely; R1's
  ban on `process::Command` in non-adapters crates is on direct usage,
  not transitive deps, so this is in scope. The opt-in shape keeps the
  existing `MockRunner` tests working with `None` and a fictional
  `/tmp/demo` repo. New `tests/job_worktree.rs` exercises completed,
  failed, and stopped terminals against a real `git init`-ed tempdir.
- Stage 1: `../ai-runner` added to `codeless/Cargo.toml` members and
  the workspace gained the `workspace.dependencies` block + `publish`
  field that ai-runner inherits via `.workspace = true`. One edit
  landed in ai-runner itself: `workspace = "../codeless"` in its
  `[package]` table — required because ai-runner lives outside the
  workspace directory tree, so Cargo's upward search can't find the
  root on its own. Bridge sits at
  `codeless-adapters-host/src/ai_runner_bridge.rs` with two entry
  points: `map_event` (pure `ai_runner::Event` → `Option<Event>`) and
  `forward_events` (drains an mpsc channel, calls a caller-supplied
  publish closure). The closure shape keeps the runtime → adapters-host
  edge intact — `EventBus` lives in runtime, so adapters-host never
  imports it. Unit tests cover Text/ToolUse/Done mapping, Connected
  + Error drop, and channel-drain ordering. MockRunner + the local
  `Runner` trait are untouched. Side-effect of the workspace join:
  `cargo fmt --check` now formats ai-runner too, which produced a
  one-off whitespace pass across `ai-runner/src/runners/*.rs`. No
  logic changes; one `// NO_PRINTLN_LINT:allow` annotation moved to
  its own line, confirmed inert (no consumer in the codeless tree).
- The vendored `ai-runner` crate sits at `ai-runner/` in the workspace
  (one level up from the inner `codeless` repo). Workspace member path
  is `../ai-runner` from the `codeless` Cargo workspace root. Pin via
  `path =` rather than the upstream `rubix-agent` crate so the loop
  never depends on network access to advance.
- `ai-runner` has its own `Runner` trait shaped around an
  `mpsc::Sender<RunnerEvent>`. Our `codeless-runtime::runner::Runner`
  shape is bus-aware. The bridge in `codeless-adapters-host` adapts
  one to the other — converting each `RunnerEvent` to a
  `codeless-types::Event` and forwarding via `EventBus::publish`.
- Process-spawning is the cross-platform tripwire here. The
  `claude-wrapper` and `anthropic-ai-sdk` deps live in `ai-runner`,
  which is host-only. The bridge crate is `codeless-adapters-host`,
  also host-only. Mobile-safe crates (`-types`, `-rpc`, `-client`)
  never see any of this. R1 from workspace `CLAUDE.md` applies — if
  a stage adds `use std::process` or `use tokio::process` anywhere
  but `codeless-adapters-host` or `ai-runner`, mark `[!]` and halt.
- Phase 2a's branch is `feat/phase-2a-persistence` and remains
  unmerged. Phase 2b commits stack on top. The PR for the combined
  branch happens at the end of stage 7.
