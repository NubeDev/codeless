# CODELESS.md — project memory

This file is the project's per-repo memory. It captures durable facts
about *this codebase* that survive across sessions, ticks, and agents.
Ephemeral context (current task, current branch state) lives in the
**session files** in the parent workspace at
[`../DOCS/sessions/`](../DOCS/sessions/), not here.

## Where to find things

Codeless lives inside a multi-repo workspace. The parent
[`codeless-workspace`](https://github.com/NubeDev/codeless-workspace)
holds the design docs, the bundled `mani` binary, and the vendored
`ai-runner` crate.

- Project scope, all decisions, the crate table, all open questions:
  [`../DOCS/SCOPE.md`](../DOCS/SCOPE.md)
- Agent-facing rules (R1-R5): [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)
- Autonomous build loop spec: [`../DOCS/JOB-LOOP.md`](../DOCS/JOB-LOOP.md)
- Loop kickoff template:
  [`../DOCS/JOB-LOOP-KICKOFF.template.md`](../DOCS/JOB-LOOP-KICKOFF.template.md)
- Multi-repo workflow: [`../DOCS/MANI.md`](../DOCS/MANI.md)
- Active session docs: [`../DOCS/sessions/`](../DOCS/sessions/)

## What this repo is, today

- A Cargo workspace at the repo root with 8 stub crates per the
  SCOPE.md crate table. Every crate compiles with `cargo check
  --workspace`; none of them does anything yet. Real work begins with
  Phase 1 of SCOPE.md.
- One bootstrap branch (`feat/bootstrap-cargo-workspace`) created by
  the bootstrap loop ([`../DOCS/sessions/2026-05-12-bootstrap-workspace.md`](../DOCS/sessions/2026-05-12-bootstrap-workspace.md)).
- No runtime, no UI, no server, no CLI yet — just the skeleton that
  enforces the layering rules.

## Durable project facts (update as the project evolves)

Add entries here when a fact becomes load-bearing and isn't already
captured in SCOPE.md. Keep entries short; if something needs more than
a paragraph, write a `DOCS/` page in the parent workspace and link to
it.

- **2026-05-12** — Bootstrap. Workspace created at
  `codeless-workspace`; `codeless` repo moved under it; vendored
  `ai-runner` from the rubix-agent workspace; mani.yaml + tasks
  written; CLAUDE.md established. Cargo workspace with 8 crate stubs
  landed on `feat/bootstrap-cargo-workspace`. Phase 1 proper has not
  started yet.
